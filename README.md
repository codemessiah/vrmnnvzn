## Running / Editing
This game was originally made back in 2016 for Godot 2.0, and I tried upgrading it to Godot 3 when it released, but they didn't support a few of the major features we used in the game, and so after days of trying, I gave up porting, and decided to leave the game on Godot 2.1.7. It's really not that bad.

So with that being said, to play or edit the game, you will need to download the older version of Godot, 2.1.7 to open the project.
