# VRMNNVZN Story
Writer: Luke I. Wilson

## Characters
 * **Commander Cook:** The Commander of the Player's dispersion force. He is brutish, and straight-forward.
 * **Centurion:** Commander Cook's on-board ship AI. Cook isn't the most brilliant thinker, so this AI guides his decisions.
 * **April:** A primary character who guides narration throughout the levels and foreshadows coming events and gives story-relevant hints. This character is female and lives on-board the ship. Personality: curious, clever.
 * **Player:** does not talk often. Personality: inquisitive.

## Plot
A large space-faring colony of humans stumble upon xenophobic space creatures, that have a hatred for alien colonies with freedoms. Very shortly after, the first battle took place at a colony ship. The colony ship containing millions of civilians was entirely destroyed, marking the beginning of the humans' first war -- the vermin invasion. The player is one of a large collection of special dispersion units. These units clear zones of hostiles by themselves because they are highly skilled.

## Use of Sound
In parts of a level where there is important action, music will be played. In story-telling sections, ambient sound will be played.

## Levels

### Prologue

An animated pixel art video cutscene introducing the plot. Maybe a narration behind it from Commander Cook?

**Choreography:** [Commander Cook]: Two months ago, we were attacked by aliens. \[Cinematic]: Shows small alien ship blast past colony ship. [Commander Cook]: These things are xenophiles, and they don't understand freedom. \[Cinematic]: The elite wasps in their ship, backs turned. [Commander Cook]: ...the strongest enslaved the weaker. \[Cinematic]: Colony ship in sight again, alone. [Commander Cook]: They destroyed our colony ship, containing 34 million unarmed civilians and children, headed for habitable planet Terris. \[Cinematic]: The small enemy ships swarm the colony ship. [Commander Cook]: This event marked the beginning of the first war \[Cinematic]: Commander Cook's lips moving. [Commander Cook continued]: -- the Vermin Invasion.

### 0 A Rookie at Hell's Gates

Since the war started rather unexpectedly, the government has not given the most attention to the training of each unit. The player is one of them -- this is their first day on the job, with very little training. They are told to disperse "only a couple hostilities in the area".

### 1 Enigma

The player discovers something big while fighting: a vermin rune typograph. The wasps developed this written language to communicate only just a hundred years ago. Commander Cook is very interested in this discovery and he needs you to find who has been writing the messages.

### 2 Into the Fog

The player goes to battle more enemies, and halfway through the level loses contact with Commander Cook. The player and April are on their own. They must work to re-establish contact... what was that sound? (Rumbling and big sound, foreshadow to a boss fight)

### 3 Spire

Lots of enemies and action. Barricades and wasps. At the end of the level, the player discovers a hive of vermins, called the Spire. They need to re-establish communications with Commander Cook to report the findings. April makes contact with nearby destroyer ship, before it is attacked.

### 4 Waking up Hell (Boss fight)

Some action, but then moments without action and rumbling. "Whatever that rumbling was when we lost contact with Commander Cook is here..." Continue fighting some light enemies and then the same rumbling before the boss appears. The boss is a robot ship built by the vermins. It spans the width of an entire level, and opens doors to release bees toward the player. Also, fires lasers. When the doors are open, the player can damage the ship by shooting through the openings. This would be easiest when the doors are open, charging lasers.

### 5 Fugitives on the Run

After the Player defeated the boss, it left a shockwave in the war. Everyone heard about it, and now they're retreating. Follow them to where they're going! The vermins lead back to the space elevator. You have to defeat enemies to make your way into it. You teleport to the vermins' home planet.

### 6 The Hornet's Nest

Switch tilesets to the fungus one.
