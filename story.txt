[Entering combat for the first time: level 1]
[No enemies]

Looks like we're in this together, {name}. I'm the Admin.

I'll be on the communications and radar, and monitoring the ship. We're connected with HQ, and I'll be relaying any important details to them about the VRMNZ. We're their frontline "scouts". Really we're in for the dirty work.

The VRMNZ are some of the dumbest space-faring pirates in the universe, but they're numerous. When they brought down our fifth colony ship... I think they became something much more united. It's hard to say.

[A bee is spotted]
There's one, on the right... Prepare to maneuver!





[Entering level 2: Enigma]
It looks like this place winds, you'll need to be quick on the steering.

[Millipede saves player]
That was a millipede. They're not one of the VRMNZ. It's very rare to see them about; they usually nest deep within the surface of these formations.

[Runes]
VRMN runes? But nobody knew they wrote. Transmitting a report to HQ.

We need to decode the messages.




[Level 3: Into the Fog]
An ambush. They were expecting us.

A swarm of those things are coming. Quick, grab that power!

Wow, that was close. Up ahead, there's more runes.

[Wasp spotted writing]
Looks like we found our Ernest Hemingway. Transmitting to HQ...

[Pass through force field]
{1 second delay}
We passed through some kind of force field. It corrupted our message, and we lost communications.

We're alone.

I can't decipher exactly what the wasps are writing, but it seems to be messages to the VRMNZ. Maybe instructions. I'll begin running a learning algorithm I've prepared.





[level 4: Spire]
Just a ways more. I'm getting disturbances directly ahead. What I believe to be a way out.
But nothing comes without *some* resistence.

[When the right side of the level is the correct to stick to]
Stay to the right side!

[On see wasp]
Oh, that does not look good.

[On wasp killed]
I can't believe he stuck around.




[Level 5: Waking up Hell]
The exit is just on the other side of this chasm. There is a lot of activity ahead, stay sharp.

[Near the end of the level]
Cutting through their defenses has really weakened them. We weren't supposed to have stepped through their shields, I suppose. They haven't been ready for us.

[About to pass through other side of force field]
Brace!

[After passing through shield]
I am reconnecting to the IGCN... Please hold.
{Delay of 3 seconds}
There are several new messages. It looks like they thought we had died upon impact of the shield. The colony is reporting major retreat for many of the VRMNZ.

I am compiling reports of our progress and I will transmit them shortly.




[Level 6: Fugitives on the Run]

[After defeating one or two waves of bees and centipedes]
They're retreating!

But to where?

[About halfway through the level]
It looks like they're headed for a last line of defense. The colony calls it The Hornet's Nest. That sounds like it might be a big fight.





[Level 7: The Hornet's Nest]
This is it: the Hornet's Nest is up ahead. Expect many hostiles.

[Upon seeing structures]
This is the hornet's nest. These structures are not natural formations. The VRMNZ built these.

[End of level]
That's it, we've broken up their last line of defense and eliminated all of the commanding wasps. The colony says they're backing off! Hah. I think the war is over. Without the wasps in command, the VRMNZ are directionless.

The commander wants us to return. He said he needs to see you. :)
